# React Image Annotator

A useful starting point for developers working on annotation software. There are multiple existing annotation libraries for react, but they are not very easy to integrate or add features to. The purpose of this project is to give developers an easy starting point for developing image annoation software.

A more complete image annotation library for React that I used for references when creating this project is:
