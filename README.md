# React Image Annotator

For developers seeking to develop image annotation software, this serves as an easy starting point. Although other open source annotation software of comparable nature are available, none of them are as simple to customize or integrate into your project.

An annotation project, for React, that I used as a reference is:
- [React Image Annotate](https://github.com/UniversalDataTool/react-image-annotate)
