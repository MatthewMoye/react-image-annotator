# React Image Annotator

An easy starting point for developers looking to create image annotation software. Other projects exist for image annotation, but they may not provide the same ease that this project will for developers creating annotation software.

An annotation project, for React, that I used as a reference is:
- [React Image Annotate](https://github.com/UniversalDataTool/react-image-annotate)
