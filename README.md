An easy starting point for developers looking to create image annotation software. Other projects exist for image annotation but may not provide the same ease that this project will for references in creating your own image annotation software.

An annotation project for React that I used for references is:
- [React Image Annotate](https://github.com/UniversalDataTool/react-image-annotate)
